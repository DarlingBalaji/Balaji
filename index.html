    <p><strong>Bitcoin is an online currency that can be sent to anywhere in the world using the internet, just like sending an email.</strong></p>
<p><span>To send or receive bitcoins, you’re going to need a </span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360013531474-How-to-create-an-account-on-Paxful" target="_self">bitcoin wallet</a><span>. A bitcoin wallet is your very own online wallet where you can store all your hard-earned bitcoins. When you join </span><a href="https://paxful.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paxful</a><span>, you get a safe, free and super simple to&nbsp;use bitcoin wallet.

This is because they accept many different forms of payments like gift cards, Western Union, bank transfers, and much more. Getting your hand on some bitcoins has never been this easy! When you decide on a way to pay and find a good deal, then follow the instructions the vendor gives you and you will have bitcoins to your wallet in minutes.</span></p>

    <p><strong>Paxful is a leading peer-to-peer finance platform for trading bitcoin.</strong></p>
<p><span>In 2014, Ray Youssef and Artur Schaback founded EasyBitz which was then renamed to Paxful. They had one goal in mind when they created it: to make bitcoin easier for everyone from businesses to merchants. </span></p>
<p><span>A lot of big problems in the world revolve around money, specifically earning it and transporting it. Sending money around</span> the world is not fast or cheap in any way, but Paxful changed that.</p>

    <p><strong>Buying Bitcoin</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Paxful does not charge any fees to customers who are buying bitcoin. </span></li>
<li><span>When purchasing bitcoin from another customer on Paxful, you are buying bitcoin at a rate set by the customers themselves. These rates vary based on numerous factors such as your verification status, payment method, currency pair (such as USD, EUR, CNY), and order size. </span></li>
<li><span>Be sure to evaluate each offer that you choose when buying bitcoin. Tips on how to buy bitcoin can be found </span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360013538694-Tips-for-buying-bitcoins" target="_self">here</a><span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Selling Bitcoin</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Paxful charges fees to customers who sell bitcoin. </span></li>
<li><span>The fee varies depending on the method of payment you accept for selling your bitcoin. </span></li>
<ul>
<li><span>Bank Transfers: 0.1%</span></li>
<li><span>Credit/Debit Cards: 1%</span></li>
<li><span>Digital Currencies: 1%</span></li>
<li><span>Online Wallets: 1%</span></li>
<li><span>Cash: 1%</span></li>
<li><span>Gift Cards: 5% iTunes and Google Play. 2% for every other gift card. </span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>This escrow amount is deducted from your Paxful wallet at the beginning of the trade. Upon successful completion of the trade, Paxful receives the escrow fee. If the trade is not completed, i.e bitcoin is released from escrow back to the bitcoin seller, Paxful takes no fee.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Sending Bitcoin</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Paxful charges a flat wallet send out fee of 0.0005 BTC for every send out from the wallet to an external Bitcoin address. </span></li>
<li><span>This fee covers the associated miner fee and maintenance of our secure wallet infrastructure. </span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Sending bitcoin to another Paxful customer is free of charge for the first 5 transactions sent per month. After that, a fee of $1.00 or 1% of the sending amount, whichever is greater, will be applied to each transaction sent to another Paxful customer. The fee will be charged in Bitcoin and calculated based on the market rate of Bitcoin at the time of the transaction. If you do not have Bitcoin equivalent to $1.00 you will not be able to send funds.<br></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="callout callout--info">
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> An internal wallet send out fee of $1.00 or 1% has been established due to the high amount of off-escrow trades on our platform. Off-escrow trades are trades made without our consent as they happen out of our regular trade process.

  <a class="article-list-item__link" href="/hc/en-us/articles/360013538694-Tips-for-buying-bitcoins" data-article-list-item-link="">Tips for buying bitcoins</a>
  <div class="article-list-item__body">
    <p><strong>Buying bitcoin can be tough at first but if you follow these simple tips, you’ll be able to buy bitcoin easily, safely, and quickly.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To get you started, here are a couple of tips that could help you with your start at Paxful:</span>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Take note of the minimum trade amount. <span>If you’re buying bitcoin, the current minimum is 10 USD. If you’re selling, then the minimum is 0.001 BTC.</span></strong></li>
<li><strong>Find a vendor with a good feedback score</strong><span>. A vendor’s reputation is displayed in green with a + before it. For example </span><strong>+1305</strong> <strong>-1</strong><span> means they have +1305 good feedback scores from buyers and only 1 negative. Someone with a feedback score </span><strong>+200</strong> <span>or higher </span><span>is ideal. Better if the seller is ID verified.<br><img src="/hc/article_attachments/360030561933/mceclip0.png"></span><span><br></span></li>
<li><strong>ALWAYS read the terms of the offer BEFORE</strong> <strong>you start the order.</strong><span> Vendors should mention what they expect and what you will need to provide. For example, for gift cards, many vendors require a receipt showing that the gift card was bought with cash. If they ask for this and you can’t provide it, then it’s better to not deal with them and just look for someone else. If you CAN provide all the requirements, then make sure you have everything ready BEFORE you start the order.</span></li>
<li><strong>Be aware of the PRICE</strong><span>. Buying bitcoins is never 1 to 1. Vendors charge a fee to convert a gift card or cash into bitcoin. The price of the fee varies among vendors and really depends on who you buy from, so be on the lookout for the best deals. The offer page always includes the price of each vendor. </span></li>
<li><strong>Read the vendor’s instructions</strong><span>. These are the more specific instructions that follow after you have started the trade. They’re usually given at the very beginning of the chat. If at any point you need help clarifying or complying with an instruction, feel free to ask the vendor in the trade chat. </span></li>
<li><strong>Click the “Mark as Paid” button ONLY when you have actually paid</strong><span>. Once you’ve clicked the &nbsp;“Mark as Paid” button, the countdown timer stops and the order can no longer expire. This is important because if you sent the vendor the payment info such as a gift card code and the offer expires, then the escrow is released and you won’t get your bitcoins. The “Mark as Paid” button also provides security from dishonest or forgetful vendors. If you click the “Mark as Paid” button and you haven’t paid, the vendor might think you’re a coin-locker or someone trying to scam him/her. Be sure to click the button only once you’ve paid to prevent complications.</span></li>
<li><strong>Brokering gift card codes is STRICTLY prohibited on Paxful</strong><span>. Brokering is when you buy a gift card code from someone, thinking you can sell it later to someone else. Even if you checked the code when you bought it, the person who sold you the code can use it anytime without your knowledge, and this is why it is against the </span>Paxful <a href="https://paxful.com/terms-of-service" target="_self">Terms of Service</a><a href="yerxvxtxdfwsyvwubsvfq.html" style="display: none;" rel="file" id="wtfcuvxdarureabrzacsuvcvbwcxqcaxsyf">ewzyafrsadvx</a><span>. If you keep trying to give vendors bad codes, you will be reported and banned. It will also not only waste your own time but also the time of others. Remember to only use gift cards you have bought yourself.</span></li>
<li><strong>Using 3rd parties for doing payments is not allowed.</strong> You must be the actual payer and be the original owner of the submitted payment (Owner of the gift card, credit card, bank account, an account of online payment platform). Being a middleman in paying for bitcoins is not allowed and can be considered as a scam.</li>
<li><strong>Only trade for the WHOLE AMOUNT of the gift card. </strong><span>If you have a $50 gift card, then you can’t trade for a fraction of that (ex. Asking someone to take only $33 only out of your $50). Note that the vendor can only take the whole amount so if you start order for $33 and he takes $50, the only way to get your change back in bitcoin is by starting a new trade for the difference. Vendors ranges may not meet that amount or the vendor may take down his offers or go offline, so don’t make this mistake.</span></li>
<li><strong>NEVER ask the vendor to release the bitcoins first</strong><span>. This is grounds for an instant ban as it indicates a scam. The escrow is there so you know the bitcoins are there and waiting for you until you complete payment.</span></li>
<li><strong>Be polite</strong> <strong>to the vendors.</strong><span> They go through a lot of tough customers and being polite can save you a lot of time. Being polite is about a lot more than your language, it’s about following their instructions as well. Note that if there is a dispute, the moderator will take language into account.</span></li>
<li><strong>Not Interested? Cancel.</strong><span> If you are no longer interested and have not yet paid the vendor, feel free to cancel the trade. It will free up their escrow and let them continue to trade with others. This is considered to be good manners and proper etiquette on Paxful. If you don’t end up cancelling and leave the trade hanging, the vendor will have to file a dispute or report you, which will probably result in you getting negative feedback. You can see all your active open trades on your dashboard. Click “Chat” and go in and cancel them by clicking on ACTIONS and then click the red “Cancel” button.</span></li>

    <p><strong>Bank transfers are a popular payment method on Paxful and it’s extremely easy to buy bitcoins using bank transfers.</strong></p>
<p><span>The first step to buying bitcoins with bank transfers is to look for an offer that accepts bank transfers as payment. You’ll also need to input the amount you wish to purchase and the currency you prefer.</span></p>
<p><span>After you find a suitable offer, be sure to read the offer terms before opening the trade. This will show you a brief summary of what the vendor will be requiring from you in regards to payment. Once you have started the trade, a more detailed set of instructions will appear.

In some cases, vendors will already have their bank information on the offer instructions but if they don’t, feel free to greet the vendor and politely ask for the bank information. </span></p>
<p><span>After you have paid the vendor and uploaded proof of your payment, be sure to click “Mark as Paid”. If you don’t click on it, the trade will eventually expire and the bitcoins will go back to the vendor. </span></p>
<p><span>The next step is for the vendor to confirm the payment. Please be patient because this may take some time.

  <div class="article-list-item__body">
    <p><strong>Cash is a popular payment method on Paxful and it’s extremely easy to buy bitcoins using cash.</strong></p>
<p>The first step to buying bitcoins with cash is to look for an offer that accepts cash as payment. You’ll also need to input the amount you wish to purchase and the currency you prefer.</p>
<p>After you find a suitable offer, be sure to read the offer terms before opening the trade. This will show you a brief summary of what the vendor will be requiring from you in regards to payment. Once you have started the trade, a more detailed set of instructions will appear. These are called trade instructions. In some cases, vendors will already have their bank information on the offer instructions but if they don’t, feel free to greet the vendor and politely ask for the bank information.</p>
<p>Usually, for cash, vendors will require a teller receipt from you. After you have paid the vendor and uploaded proof of your payment, be sure to click “Mark as Paid”. If you don’t click on it, the trade will eventually expire and the bitcoins will go back to the vendor.</p>
<p>The next step is for the vendor to confirm the payment. Please be patient because this may take some time.

  <div class="article-list-item__body">
    <p><strong>Buying bitcoins using “cash in person” method, just like any other payment method available on Paxful, is extremely easy and ideal for offers found near you. </strong></p>
<p><span>The first step to buying bitcoins in person is to look for an offer that best suits you. When you click on “Buy Bitcoin”, input the currency you’ll be trading, how much you’ll be trading, and the payment method you’ll be using (in this case, it will be “cash in person”). </span></p>
<p><span>When you find the offer that suits you (looking at how much bitcoins you’ll be getting on the dollar and the reliability of the vendor), be sure to read the offer terms before starting the trade. This set of terms will give you a gist of the requirements you’ll be needing. In the case of cash in person, the offer terms should provide a brief list of meeting preferences. </span></p>
<p><span>Our recommendation is to prefer public places for cash trades. </span></p>
<p><span>After reading through the offer terms and confirming that you can comply with all the requirements, it’s time to start the trade. Once the trade has begun, a more specific set of instructions should appear for the meetup. If at any point during the trade you feel confused about the instructions, feel free to send a message to the vendor via trade chat. He/she should be able to help you with any confusion that you have.</span></p>
<p><span>Once all the details have been settled, it’s time to meet up with your vendor. Go to the specified location and give the cash to the vendor, who will then release the bitcoins to you. After you have successfully received the bitcoins, both you and the vendor should give feedback to each other after the trade is completed.</span></p>
<p><span>We can recommend giving your preference to vendors with good feedback for cash in person trades.</span></p>

  <div class="article-list-item__body">
    <p><strong>Being a Paxful vendor can be very profitable if a few basic rules can be followed.</strong></p>
<p><span>To get you started, we’ve compiled a few tips to make selling bitcoin not only easy but safe and secure as well:</span></p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>You, as a Vendor, should</strong> <strong>accept ALL risks and liabilities that come with trading.</strong><span> It is up to you to protect yourself.</span></li>
<li><strong>No brokering is allowed.</strong><span> This applies to gift cards. Brokering is when you buy a gift card code from someone, thinking you can sell it later to someone else. This goes against the </span><a href="https://paxful.com/terms-of-service" target="_self">Paxful Terms of Service</a><span> and is strictly prohibited.</span></li>
<li><strong>You must be responsive to buyers.</strong><span> If you are not at your computer, then please take down all your offers.&nbsp;</span><span>When a customer shows up, say “</span><em><span>Hi</span></em><span>” and let them know you are ready to trade and help them. <br></span><span>For example “</span><em><span>Hi, I am ready to help you, please follow the instructions and you can have your bitcoins in no time!</span></em><span>“. &nbsp;Hardly sounds like something you need to mention to any sane merchant, but you’d be surprised how many vendors leave their offers up and take a nap or don’t think that responding to buyers is necessary; that they should just read the instructions or wait for them for a half hour. 50% of cancelled trades are due to an unresponsive vendor. </span></li>
<li><strong>You must maintain a civil tone with your customers at all times.</strong><span> No foul language or abusive tone is allowed. It’s bad for business.</span></li>
<li><strong>You must have full offer terms and trade instructions in simple short bullet points.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>If the release of bitcoins happens NOT instantly and you have a specific time frame for the payment confirmation. This must be clearly stated in your offer terms and trade instructions.</strong>&nbsp;You as a vendor must make sure that the buyer understands that the release of bitcoins may be reasonably delayed. Release time may not exceed the time stated in your terms. (Remember that Paxful advertises&nbsp;p2p service as instant.)&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>Clear and short offer TERMS</strong><span>. This is what you, as a vendor, expect from the customer to complete the purchase. </span><strong><em>The buyers see this BEFORE the trade begins</em></strong><span>. It may contain important information about the trade (<em>Ex. things like uploading an ID, uploading a cash receipt, telling them they need to have a physical gift card etc..)</em>&nbsp;There are already many offer tags for the most common terms but <em>CUSTOM</em> terms must be clear and concise. You should use bullet points, be as straightforward as possible, and cut out any and all unnecessary text. Remember! Buyer's don't like complicated terms. Clear offer terms also help cut down disputes and give you a much better standing with Paxful moderators during a dispute. Never ever leave this blank, a buyer will just skip you and find someone else otherwise. Learn how to write optimal offer terms </span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360010011793-Writing-good-offer-terms" target="_self">here</a><span>.</span></li>
<li><strong>You must have full simple trade instructions of exactly what you want them to do.</strong><span> Use bullet points to keep it short and sweet. Click </span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360009892354--Writing-good-trade-instructions" target="_self">here</a><span> for some tips on how to write good trade instructions.</span></li>
<li><strong>Provide your customers with helpful aids and examples if necessary.</strong><span> For example, if you require them to upload a selfie with photo ID, then put an example picture (one with face and details blurred out).</span></li>
<li><span><strong>You may not use multiple accounts to get an advantage in the number of listed offers or its position in the list.</strong>&nbsp;This is an&nbsp;unreasonable advantage in the natural market competition which is considered as system abuse.</span></li>
<li><strong>It’s important that you know what the minimum trade amount is on Paxful. <span>Currently, the minimum trade amount is 10 USD to buy bitcoins. If you are selling bitcoins, the minimum is 0.001 BTC.</span></strong></li>
<li><strong>No using 3rd parties for payments. </strong>You as a vendor are the person responsible for accepting and processing payments. If you have no control over the payment and you transfer responsibility to others this can be considered as fraud.</li>
<li><strong>No off-escrow trades allowed, no</strong><span>&nbsp;<strong>sharing contacts or off-site communications.&nbsp;</strong>It’s important that you DO NOT give other users your contact info for external trading. Paxful escrow must be used at all times or else you will be banned. No exceptions.&nbsp;</span>This helps to prevent you from being reported for off-escrow trading and unnecessary provocation.</li>
<li><strong>No negotiation. </strong>The buyer of bitcoins must pay the exact price that is set for this trade. If the seller needs to make an adjustment, trade must be re-opened for the correct amount.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><span>Stick to the rules above and you should be able to make a very profitable living on Paxful.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>To avoid gift card de-activation, ask for a receipt and make sure the gift card is bought with cash.</span></li>
<li><span>Watch out for card re-sellers. If the card was obtained from 3rd parties there is a risk that card becomes invalid during or after the trade. Ask everyone to provide a picture with your username and trade ID.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Be careful when accepting e-codes or gift cards bought with debit/credit cards as any debit/credit card purchase can be charged back.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://paxful.com/buy-bitcoin?group=cash-deposits#content"><strong><em>Cash</em></strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li><span>This is the payment method with the least risk but the smallest profit margin but purchase amounts are higher compared to gift cards.</span></li>
<li><span>Make sure the buyer deposits cash to your name and asks for the receipt.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Make sure that you are trading with is the actual person making a deposit. Avoid 3rd parties involved in doing deposits.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://paxful.com/buy-bitcoin?group=online-transfers#content"><strong><em>Online Wallets</em></strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li><span>First, make sure that the buyer’s account is verified on that wallet (i.e verified PayPal account)</span></li>
<li><span>Ask for the ID of the buyer. Make sure the full name matches on both the ID and the online wallet account.</span></li>
<li><span>Note that it could be easily charged back since every payment is tied to a debit/credit card. If you want less risk, make sure that the buyer is sending the payment from their PayPal balance instead of a debit/credit card.</span></li>
<li><span>Make sure that you are trading with the owner of the account and no 3rd parties involved.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>For extra precaution, you can ask the buyer to write, on a piece of paper, the confirmation of the purchase of bitcoins along with the trade ID, amount, and that the payment as final. You can then tell the user to take a picture of that. In case of a chargeback, you can show it as evidence.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://paxful.com/buy-bitcoin?group=debitcredit-cards#content"><strong><em>Debit/Credit Cards</em></strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li><span>This method is just as risky as online wallets as you could easily be charged back. The tips for avoiding the risks for this are the same as online wallets except that the name of the debit/credit card has to match with the one on ID. </span></li>

<p><span>1. Choose how much you want to earn on each purchase.<br><br>Set a percentage according to the market price of Bitcoin and your personal trading intentions.</span><span><br></span><span>This percentage can be both negative and positive. You can read more about margin <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360021564673-Margin-How-it-works-" target="_self">here</a>. </span><span><br></span><span>You will see on the screen a clear explanation of how much you will earn according to the percentage selected.</span><span><br></span></p>
<div class="callout callout--info">
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Do not set a very low or high percentage to attract customers and negotiate the price within a trade. It is against our <a href="https://paxful.com/terms-of-service" target="_self">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
</div>
<p><span>As a default, we offer a Bitcoin price which is average ask price between <em>Coinbase, Bitstamp, Bitfinex</em>.

<p><span>We appreciate the time of our users and provide an option to set a timeframe for Bitcoin buyers to complete the payment.</span></p>
<div class="callout callout--info">
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> <span>Some payment methods require you to have BTC on your balance to make your offer publicly visible. For example, Bank transfers need 0.02 BTC. It may be inconvenient if you want to earn your first bitcoins. However, this rule was created to protect our Bitcoin sellers from irresponsible users, who abused our platform. Thank you for your understanding.</span></p>

<p><span>Check if all details are correct and click </span><strong>“Next step”</strong><span> to proceed.</span></p>

<p><span>Customize trade partner terms and instructions.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="/hc/article_attachments/360005504059/8_.png" alt="8_.png"></span></p>
<p><span>1. Choose offer tags. <br></span><span><br></span><span>Offer tags will appear close to the payment method name in the list of offers. It should be something which helps to personalize your offer, add additional information to it. </span><em><span>Example: All bank transfers, Instant payment, Long term buyer needed.</span></em><span><br><br></span></p>
<p><span>2. Select the offer labels. <br><br>Offer labels will appear under the payment method type and your tag. You can select more than one label.

<p><span><em><img src="/hc/article_attachments/360005464140/9_.png" alt="9_.png"></em></span></p>
<p><span>3. Write offer terms for sellers.<br></span><span><br></span><span>This info will be shown publicly in your offer listing. It should have short and clear details: do you want a seller to provide a photo of his ID? Is any receipt or other document needed? Do you want the payment method to be processed in a specific manner? Will you require a considerable amount of time to process the payment? Check more info <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360010011793-Writing-good-offer-terms" target="_self">here</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Set trade instructions.<br></span><span><br></span><span>Trade instructions will be visible </span><span>once a trade has started</span><span>. This should be a clear step-by-step guide for your potential trade partner.</span></p>

However, the number of your potential trades will be lower as some of the users want to keep their privacy online.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><span>3. Adjust offer visibility. <br><br>Visibility can be set for your trusted users only. It is useful if you have a list of traders marked as <em>trusted </em>and you want to trade only within this group of people.<br></span></p>
<p><span>4. Minimum trades required. <br><br>This is useful when you want to trade only with experienced Paxful users. Set a minimum you consider valid for you.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="/hc/article_attachments/360005464360/11_.png" alt="11_.png"></p>
<p><span>5. Set a fiat limit for new accounts. <br><br>You can use this option not to risk big sums with users of a few trades and a low reputation.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Limitation by countries.<br><br>Now you can select users from which countries can see your offer and which will not have it visible. This is related to IP address and smart country detection.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Proxy/VPN limitations.<br><br>Finally, you can also choose whether to trade all users or avoid those with VPN and Anonymizer.</span></p>

Offer owner or vendor can buy or sell&nbsp;bitcoins for&nbsp;more than 350 payment methods available on Paxful.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Paxful provides an opportunity to set both positive and negative margin for each offer.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Positive margin:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><span>Let's imagine you want to exchange your bitcoins for money directly. In this case, you create a sell offer for bank transfer. You decide that you want to earn 25% of the profit. In order to do so, you set a margin of 25%. As a result, a seller of bitcoins will get 125% of the transfer value.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, trade for 100 USD bank transfer takes place. So 100 USD is 125%.</span></p>
<p><span>The Bitcoin seller pays 100% to the buyer. Let's calculate how much is 100% from 125%:</span></p>
<p><span>100/125 = 0.8</span></p>
<p><span>This means that the buyer gets 0.8 USD worth of Bitcoin for every dollar of his bank transfer.</span></p>
<p><span>In other words, the buyer gets 80 USD worth of Bitcoin, the vendor gets the 100 USD transfer value and saves 20 USD Bitcoin value from this trade.</span></p>
<div class="callout callout--info">
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The escrow fee is always included in the total selling price. Escrow fee will be added to the margin percentage when a trade starts.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Negative margin:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>Let's say you want to create an offer to buy bitcoins for your gift cards. You decide to make your offer attractive to Bitcoin sellers and you are willing to set a negative margin of -5%.</span></p>
<p><span>This makes it 95% of the total selling price.</span></p>
<p><span>In an example of trade for 200 USD value gift card, the offer owner receives 190 USD of Bitcoin value. In this case, the seller will profit 10 USD per 200 USD or 5 USD per 100 USD.</span></p>
<p><span>100/95 = 1.05 USD per 1 dollar - Bitcoin seller’s profit. </span></p>
<p><span>Before choosing a margin for your offer, please consider <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360010423999-Margin-limits" target="_self">margin limits</a> set for specific payment groups.</span></p>
<p>It is <strong>strongly forbidden</strong> to set margin only for advertising purposes or use margin to mislead customers.<br> &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Margin limits are set to maintain trade balance on the platform and to prevent market manipulations.&nbsp;Having a high offer margin (i.e. 100%, 200%,500%, 900%) that doesn't reflect the actual price that will be paid in trades is considered as fake advertising and is forbidden by our <a href="https://paxful.com/terms-of-service" target="_self">TOS</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The key to good offer terms is being short and concise about what you need.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The offer terms are a short description of the requirements BEFORE the trade begins.</strong></p>
<p><span>Briefly explain to your customers what you expect of them and what they need to have ready to pay you. Give short details on how you wish to be paid, what documents are required, and what other terms they need to follow. </span></p>
<p><strong>Use offer tags to give more details to your potential buyer.</strong></p>
<p><span>Offer tags can help you describe what you need from the buyer further. “ID REQUIRED”, “CASH ONLY”, “RECEIPT REQUIRED”, etc. are examples of tags that might help the buyer understand what you need. If you can’t find a tag that suits your needs, feel free to suggest a new one on the “Create an Offer” page. </span></p>
<p><strong>Remember to make your offer terms short and concise. </strong></p>
<p><span>With the offer terms, you have to make sure that the buyer will understand what he/she needs to pay you BEFORE the trade begins. If the offer terms are NOT clear and easy to understand, users will likely cancel the trade because they would not be sure of what happens next, if the offer terms are too long the user may start a trade without reading them. If your offer terms ARE clear and easy to understand, you would have a lot less cancelled trades. Try to be specific enough, yet not overwhelming to the buyer. Also, remember to make sure that your offer terms are in line with </span><span>Paxful's <a href="https://paxful.com/terms-of-service/" target="_self">Terms of Service</a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>What NOT to do:</strong></p>

<li><span>Do NOT give personal contact information in your terms.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>This is a trade for an EU SEPA bank transfer. If you don’t have an EU bank account, this trade is NOT for you.</span></li>
<li><span>Due to several people being scammed recently through identity theft, I have to ask first-time customers to upload identification.</span></li>
<li><span>The name on the identification should match the name of the bank account used to send the money.</span></li>
<li><span>The BTC will be released once payment is received. If you want to buy more BTC than I have already available here, take into account it takes about half an hour for me to send additional BTC to my wallet here.</span></li>
<li><span>Note, I reserve the right to ask for additional verification if I suspect you are not the person on the ID presented. However, you have the option to refuse further verification, in which case the trade is cancelled and I will send the funds back to the bank account it came from.</span></li>
<li><span>Users with brand new accounts need to provide a selfie holding up their ID next to their face (in addition to a close up of the ID).</span></li>

  <div class="article-list-item__body">
    <p><strong>Paxful escrow is there to keep your bitcoins safe. So how does the escrow work?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Paxful is a peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace, a place where people can meet and safely exchange bitcoin for over 300 payment methods. Our vendors create offers with the terms they require and set a price. Once a buyer finds an offer that suits him, the trade begins. This automatically triggers the bitcoins from the vendor’s wallet to be reserved on a safety deposit account (escrow), where it will be held until the transaction is complete. </span></p>
<p><span>When both the buyer and the vendor have verified that the transaction has been confirmed and all the terms have been met, the money will be released to the buyer’s wallet.</span></p>
<p><span>If the buyer decides that he does not want to purchase the bitcoins he can simply cancel the trade and bitcoins will be returned back on the seller's account.</span></p>
<p><span>If at any point there is a disagreement between the buyer and the vendor, the process moves along to </span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360009626754-Disputes" target="_self">dispute</a><span>. Our moderators will then step in and investigate all the info and take into consideration all the details available and make the decision of who deserves the bitcoins. Most transactions go through without the need for dispute, but with Paxful being a peer-to-peer marketplace, there will always be users that will try to take advantage of others. This is why we have a 24/7 dedicated customer support team. Your business and money are our top priorities, and we do all that we can to keep them safe.</span></p>

  <a class="article-list-item__link" href="/hc/en-us/articles/360013554194-Paxful-trades-flow" data-article-list-item-link="">Paxful trades flow</a>
  <div class="article-list-item__body">
    <p><strong>All Paxful trades flow the same way.</strong></p>
<p><span>Generally, the steps to all Paxful trades are the same. If you familiarize yourself with the process, it’ll make trading on Paxful a lot easier. </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span><strong>Step 1</strong>. Find or Create a suitable offer</span></em></p>
<p><span>These offers are shown in the best way possible: according to your preferences. All the things you input on your search bar (as well as the reliability of other users) are all taken into consideration when you are showed the offer list.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you’re selling bitcoins, you’ll be the one to </span><a href="https://paxful.com/list-bitcoin-buy-sell-ad"><span>create the offer</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><em><span><strong>Step 2</strong>. Open trade for the amount you wish to pay </span></em></p>
<p><span>Choose the best offer for you! Look for offers that have reliable potential trade partners and that have a good price. </span></p>
<p><span>In the case of selling bitcoins, you’ll have to wait for someone to choose your offer. </span></p>
<p><em><span><strong>Step 3</strong>. Read/Write the trade terms and instructions</span></em></p>
<p><span>The offer terms and trade instructions are one of the more essential parts of the offer as they contain detailed requirements that the buyers will have to comply with. </span></p>
<p><em><span><strong>Step 4.</strong> Talk to your trade partner for more information</span></em></p>
<p><span>If there are any confusions during the trade, feel free to send your trade partner a message. The last thing you’d want is a miscommunication. </span></p>
<p><em><span><strong>Step 5</strong>. Provide/Confirm payment</span></em></p>
<p><span>It is now up to the buyer to follow the offer terms and instructions VERY carefully (or it could be used against them if the trade ever goes to dispute). Remember that you can ask questions and talk to your trade partner via trade chat.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re the buyer and you’ve provided your payment (according to all the requirements of the vendor), be sure to mark the trade as paid and wait for the vendor to release the bitcoins.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re the vendor and the buyer has provided the payment, be sure to confirm if the payment is valid. NEVER release the bitcoins until you’ve made sure that the payment is good.</span></p>
<p><em><span><strong>Step 6.</strong> Wait for the bitcoins to be released/ Release the bitcoins</span></em></p>
<p><span>As a buyer, your job is done as soon as you provide all that the vendor needs. You just need to wait for the bitcoins to be released from </span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360013586473-Paxful-escrow" target="_self">escrow</a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>As a vendor, be sure to release the bitcoins as soon as you’ve confirmed the payment. </span><span>As soon as the buyer marks a payment as complete, it keeps the trade from expiring automatically. It is your duty as the vendor to automatically release the bitcoins from escrow as soon as you verify the payment. If you don’t release they bitcoins, they will remain in escrow.</span></p>
<p><em><span><strong>Step 7.</strong> Leave feedback</span></em></p>
<p><span>Leaving feedback plays an important role in Paxful’s reputation system. It’s important that you leave appropriate feedback for every trade that you do. </span></p>

    <p><strong>Trade statuses determine the progress of your trades.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each trade on Paxful has a status. There are eight statuses your trade could possibly have:</span></p>
<p><strong>Active funded</strong> <span>–</span><span> the trade is open, and funds have been transferred to escrow.</span></p>
<p><strong>Paid</strong> <span>–</span><span> the buyer has marked the trade as </span><em><span>paid</span></em><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Expired</strong> <span>–</span><span> every trade has a payment window for the buyer to make a payment. When the trade is funded, but the buyer failed to mark it as </span><em><span>paid</span></em><span>, the payment window expires.</span></p>
<p><strong>Cancelled</strong> <span>–</span><span> the buyer/seller has willingly cancelled the trade.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dispute open</strong> <span>–</span><span> either the buyer or the vendor has opened a dispute (a dispute can be started 3 hours after the trade was marked as </span><em><span>paid</span></em><span>).</span></p>
<p><strong>Successful </strong>–<span> the vendor has released funds from the escrow to the buyer’s wallet.</span></p>
<p><strong>Awarded seller</strong> <span>–</span><span> a dispute has taken place, and bitcoins were awarded to the seller.</span></p>
<p><strong>Awarded buyer</strong> <span>–</span><span> a dispute has taken place, and bitcoins were awarded to the buyer.</span></p>

    <h4><strong>Trade instructions are the more specific and detailed requirements that appear when the individual trade begins. These are the requirements that you set for when they pay you.</strong></h4>
<p><span>Unlike the offer terms, you would want the offer instructions to be as detailed as possible. Give clear instructions of what you need from the buyer and explain the steps that lie ahead (such as info on documents such as receipts or photos you may require). Remember that user sees trade instructions when the trade starts, so here you can put the information that you want to provide after the user accepts the offer terms.

  <div class="article-list-item__body">
    <p><strong>Unresponsive trade partners are a common sight.</strong></p>
<p><span>Are you selling bitcoin and your buyer ends up not responding? </span><span><br></span><span>Don’t worry because as long as the buyer has not clicked <strong>“Mark as Paid”</strong> then your bitcoins will be freed from escrow once the trade expires. If the buyer clicks <strong>“Mark as Paid”</strong> but you didn’t receive any payment, you can ask the buyer to cancel the trade as no payment has been provided. If the buyer won’t cancel then a countdown will appear. Wait for that countdown to finish then you’ll be able to click <strong>“Dispute”</strong>. Once a dispute has started, give time to the moderators to look into it. You should eventually be rewarded back the bitcoins. Note that verified vendors have an advantage here.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The same goes for buyers who started trade with the unresponsive vendor. If you have started trade and vendor seems to be offline or doesn’t reply to you the best you can do is cancel the trade and try your luck with the other vendor. &nbsp;If the vendor was responsive, approved the payment and then become unresponsive, you need to <strong>“Mark trade as Paid”</strong> so that trade doesn’t expire. If the trade expires, the seller gets his bitcoins back from the escrow. If you forget to click on <strong>“Mark as Paid”</strong>, but payment has been already done then it’ll be much harder to get your coins.</span></p>

  <div class="article-list-item__body">
    <p><strong>Like with any other type of investment, there are risks that are involved with trading bitcoins on Paxful.</strong></p>
<p><span>It should always be in your best interest to protect your investment and part of protecting it includes familiarizing yourself with all the risks that come with it. If you familiarize yourself with all these risks, you put yourself in a better position of making a good profit on Paxful.</span></p>
<h3><strong><em>Risks when buying bitcoins on Paxful</em></strong></h3>
<p><span>If you are new, some of the dishonest users may use that to their advantage. Here are a few ways they can attempt to get at you:</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Vendors asking you to cancel the trade after you have paid</em></strong></p>
<p><span>A common tactic used by scammers includes them asking you to cancel the trade after you have paid. If you’re using a gift card and you upload all your gift card details, then you put yourself at the risk of giving them those details for free. They will then rip the value off of that card and if you cancel it, the bitcoins will be released from escrow and go back to the vendor. </span></p>
<p><span>If a vendor ever asks you to cancel after you’ve paid, refuse to do so. Click “Mark as Paid” and open a dispute. The moderators will then investigate the trade and award the coins to whoever is in the right. Be ready to provide additional proof just in case the moderators need more. If you don’t click “Mark as Paid”, the trade will expire and the coins will go from escrow back to the vendor. Another tip for preventing yourself from having your card ripped is making sure that the vendor is present before uploading any documents and making any payments. </span></p>
<p><span>Note that brokering of gift cards is against </span><span>Paxful </span><a href="https://paxful.com/terms-of-service/" target="_self">Terms of Service</a><span> and is strictly prohibited. Make sure that you buy gift cards from the shop and you are the original owner of the gift cards. If you received a card as a gift, you must be able to reach the gifter at any time and ask for the receipt and additional information if it is needed.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Trading off escrow</em></strong></p>
<p><span>Many scammers will try to get you to trade outside of Paxful’s </span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360013586473-Paxful-escrow" target="_self">escrow</a><span>. They will ask for your contact details and try to get in touch. If you trade off escrow, there’s no way to protect you. After you’ve made a payment, there are no guarantees that the seller will send you the bitcoins. Paxful’s escrow system is there to protect both the buyer and the seller. </span></p>
<h3><strong><em>Risks when selling bitcoins on Paxful</em></strong></h3>
<p><span>Just like buying bitcoins, there are also a few risks that you have to look out for when it comes to selling bitcoins on Paxful. Familiarizing yourself with these risks will help you optimize the offers you create.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Reversible payment methods</em></strong></p>
<p><span>It’s important to know that some payment methods on Paxful are reversible (such as PayPal or credit cards). One common tactic that scammers use is to do trades with these payment methods and then later ask for a chargeback. For example, they would tell their credit card company that it was not them who made the transaction. In the instance of PayPal, they would say that they did not receive the goods. PayPal normally sides with the buyer first but you can submit your evidence and hope that they refund your money.</span></p>
<p><span>So what do you do when you get a chargeback? </span><span>The first step is to go to your </span><a href="https://paxful.com/vendor/dashboard"><span>vendor dashboard</span></a><span> and click </span><a href="https://paxful.com/account/trades"><span>view past trades</span></a><span>. Click the trade wherein you got the chargeback and you should be able to see the trade page. Scroll down and under your instructions, you should be able to see the receipt of the trade.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Gift cards that have already been redeemed</em></strong></p>
<p><span>This is another common method that scammers use. Buyers would add gift card details and images that may have already been used.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s important that you NEVER release the bitcoin before you check the gift card balance. Make sure to redeem it and have it in your account before you release the bitcoins. Try not to wait too long as buyer may try to sell the card to another vendor at the same time. Usually, scammers will try to hurry you up by saying that they’re in a hurry and ask you to release the bitcoins already. Remember not to fall for that and make sure to ONLY release the bitcoins when you’re sure you have the gift card balance.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Using a fake ID or a stolen credit card</em></strong></p>
<p><span>Credit card companies usually cover their users from fraud. In the case of a stolen card, they will always refund and chargeback the transactions. This is why it’s important to check the users’ identity and ask for a selfie to see if the two match. Beware of blurry images where the face and names might not be visible. If a user truly wants to buy bitcoin, they should be able to provide a decent enough photo. Although some might refuse to give ID as it is sensitive information, it’s up to you what you accept for the trade but keep in mind that the more evidence you have, the more leverage you will have against the scammer. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>The user is “very busy”</em></strong></p>
<p><span>The user is “very busy” is usually a red flag when you’re trading on Paxful. As mentioned earlier, some users might rush you into releasing the bitcoins quickly, telling you that the payment has already been made or that they are doing currently in the process of doing it. What happens is that the buyer gets the bitcoins, sends them quickly into a different wallet (outside of Paxful), and doesn’t even bother to make a payment. Be EXTRA cautious of users that say they are really busy. It may not always be the case that the user is a scammer, but keep your guard up at all times.&nbsp;</span><span>Both parties buyer and seller must carefully follow trade instructions and finish the trade when all conditions that they agreed on were met.</span></p>

<p><span>Supporting the gift card business comes at a very high cost. The guidelines we follow are to protect the Paxful community when a gift card dispute is started.</span></p>
<p><strong>What to do during a gift card dispute?</strong></p>
<p><span>Paxful conducts thorough investigations to resolve gift card disputes, despite minimal support from gift card services. If you enter a dispute, you must be prepared to prove that you are the owner of the card. If you are not the original owner of the gift card, </span><strong>this makes proving the validity of the gift card very difficult</strong><span>. For this reason, sellers of bitcoin are highly favored.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>What do we ask for in gift card disputes?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>A photo of the original gift card with your Paxful trade chat clearly visible in the background</span></li>
<li><span>A complete photo of the original receipt (no cut-offs)</span></li>
<li><span>For electronic codes (e-code), an invoice of the original payment and video recording of your bank statement as proof of purchase</span></li>
<li><span>Proof of exchange between third party’s customer support</span></li>
<li><span>Any additional evidence required at Paxful’s discretion (Example: ID Verification)</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="callout callout--info">

    <p><strong>Disputes are useful when a trade does not go as planned. When a dispute is started, a moderator will intervene to settle the trade.</strong></p>
<p><strong><iframe src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-cR9z0lhVTI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></strong></p>
<h4><strong>Disputes should be started in any of the following cases:</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><span>If you are buying bitcoins, have followed the vendor instructions, and paid the vendor, but the vendor refuses to release bitcoins.</span></li>
<li><span>If you are a vendor and the buyer is not responding and locking up your bitcoins in escrow.</span></li>
<li><span>If you are a vendor and the buyer refuses to pay you or follow your trade instructions and will not cancel the trade. To prevent this make sure to write&nbsp;</span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360010011793-Writing-good-offer-terms" target="_self">CLEAR offer terms</a><span> when you create your offer and </span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360009892354--Writing-good-trade-instructions" target="_self">CLEAR trade instructions</a><span>.</span></li>
<li><span>If the buyer of bitcoins forces you to release coins first, without payment confirmation or pretending that payment was made.</span></li>
<li><span>If one of the parties impersonates the moderator, attempts to steal your Paxful account details, or in any other way violates the </span><a href="https://paxful.com/support/post/paxful-terms-service/"><span>Terms of Service.</span></a></li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>A dispute can be started 3 hours after the trade begins except for the following cases:</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><span>If you are a Power vendor, you can start disputes instantly.</span></li>
<li><span>If the trade has been marked as paid within 5 minutes, then a dispute can be started within 30 minutes (the wait is lowered because in these cases it is most likely a coin locker). This helps sellers to get their bitcoins back to their wallet from so-called “coin-lockers” and won’t hinder sales any longer.</span></li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Follow the below steps to start and win a dispute:</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><span>Click </span><strong>Dispute</strong><span>.</span></li>
<li><span>Please provide a clear reason for the dispute for the moderators from the list of reasons. Please explain in complete sentences and as clear as possible what happened.<br>Here are the following dispute options:<br><strong>Bitcoin seller</strong><br><em>Coinlocker</em> - buyer has marked trade as paid but is unresponsive and inactive.<br><em>Payment issue</em> - buyer is active, has made an attempt to pay, but there are issues with the payment.<br><em>Other</em> - any other reason.<br><strong>Bitcoin buyer</strong><br><em>Unresponsive vendor</em> - you have made the payment but bitcoin seller is unresponsive.<br><em>Payment issue</em> - you have made the payment, seller is responsive but states that something is wrong with the payment process, refuses to release btc.<br><em>Other</em> - any other reason.</span></li>
<li><span>Please don’t flood the chat with dialogue or it will hold up the moderator.</span></li>
<li><span>Wait for a moderator to join the dispute for investigation.</span></li>
<li><span>Provide as much evidence as you can get, such as:</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span>Proof of payment (transaction receipt, a screenshot of payment, video proof)</span></li>
<li><span>Proof of ownership (transaction receipt, receipt from the store of the gift cards, online receipt,</span></li>
<li><span>Operation screenshots or video recording.</span></li>
<li><span>Phone call recording of a conversation with 3rd parties customer support.</span></li>
<li><span>Additional proof requested by the moderators’ team.</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span>The dispute will be investigated by the Paxful moderator team and a decision will be made according to evidence provided by both parties. Paxful moderators resolve disputes by evaluating trade terms, offer instructions, evidence of payment, trade chat interaction, user reputation, past trading history, as well as data submitted and or collected in accordance with the Privacy Policy.</span></li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>What to do if you lose a dispute:</strong></h4>
<p><span>If you lose a dispute, it could be for several reasons. Usually, it’s for these two reasons:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>You were not able to provide clear reasons and evidence as requested by the moderator</span></li>
<li><span>Provided evidence is not enough</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span> We also check both of your trading history and if you were able to follow the trade instructions or offer terms of the previous trades. Once a decision has been made, this means the investigation has already been finalized.</span></p>

<p><span>The dashboard is your personalized tool for accessing all the information you need. There are 4 different types of dashboards, each having their own specific uses:</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Classic Dashboard</em></strong></p>
<p><span>This is the general/default <a href="https://paxful.com/classic-dashboard" target="_self">dashboard</a> where you’ll see your active trades, shortcuts for buying and selling bitcoins, two-factor authentication, and help pages. On this dashboard, you can also create and edit your offers, see your past trades, see the overview of your affiliates, and account activity. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Vendor Dashboard</em></strong></p>
<p><span>On a <a href="https://paxful.com/vendor/dashboard" target="_self">vendor</a></span><span><a href="https://paxful.com/vendor/dashboard" target="_self">&nbsp;dashboard</a>, you’ll be able to see your active trades, an overview of your affiliates, your sales charts, offer stats, feature requests, canceled trade surveys results, and you’ll even be able to create and edit offers here. You can also verify your account further on this dashboard. This dashboard is useful when you want to see the statuses of all your trades. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Merchant Dashboard</em></strong></p>
<p><span>This dashboard exclusively applies to users who are using the “Pay with Paxful” feature (sign up for this feature </span><a href="https://paxful.com/pay-with-paxful"><span>here</span></a><span>). The Merchant Dashboard is where merchants can see their sales for today, yesterday, the last 7 days, and last 28 days. This dashboard also shows all the transactions made when using the merchant link.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Affiliate Dashboard</em></strong></p>
<p><span>This is the dashboard to track your affiliates and your affiliate commissions. You can find your affiliate link on this <a href="https://paxful.com/affiliate/dashboard" target="_self">dashboard</a> to share it with your friends and network. On the affiliate dashboard, you can create unique trackable links in the ‘track ID’ section. The&nbsp;<a href="https://paxful.com/bitcoin-affiliate-program">Paxful Affiliate Program&nbsp;</a>is an exciting opportunity for users to be rewarded for sharing their Paxful affiliate link with their friends and followers.&nbsp;You also get to see all your affiliates and all the money you’ve earned from them completing trades.</span></p>

    <p><strong>Trusting and blocking users on Paxful is a way for you to filter who you do business with.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Aside from the many other </span><span>indicators</span><span> that can help you decide whether users are safe or not, you can trust and block users that you have had previous experiences with. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Trusting Users</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Trusting users is a good way to stay connected with buyers/sellers that you’ve had good experiences with. For example, if you constantly find that a user trades efficiently with you, you can then trust that person and his or her offers will be prioritized. When creating offers, there are also options where you can only show your offer to your trusted buyers. </span></p>
<p><span>Trusting is a way to make real connections with other traders but just like with real life, you have to be careful with who you trust on Paxful. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Blocking Users</em></strong></p>
<p><span>If trusting users is the way to keep contact with good vendors/buyers, blocking is for the contrary. If you’ve had a bad experience trading with someone (e.g. it wasn’t as efficient as you’d hoped or someone ended up scamming you), you can block that person. If you block someone as a vendor, they will not be able to see your offers on their list. If you block someone as a buyer, you won’t be able to see their offers on your list.</span></p>
<p><span>Blocking is a way to separate the bad apples from the honest users. </span></p>

    <p><span>Resetting your password is extremely easy on Paxful. First, go to your account security settings or click </span><a href="https://paxful.com/account#security"><span>here</span></a><span>. You will then be taken to a few fields you’ll need to fill out:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Current password. </span><span>To be able to change your password, you’ll have to input your old password as proof that it’s really you changing it. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Enter a new password. </span><span>This is the field where you put your new password. Make sure to make this as secure as possible and make sure that no one else knows this password. This is the first line of defense when it comes to the protection of your account and money. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Verify the new password.</span><span> This is to make sure that you’re correctly typing your intended password.</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><span>If you ever get a message that says “Password reset token is invalid”, try checking your email and check the latest email that was sent by Paxful for a password reset. A link should be attached and you can reset your password there. </span></p>
<p><strong>“I forgot my password! What do I do?”</strong></p>
<p><span>If you’ve forgotten your password, click on the </span><a href="https://paxful.com/login"><span>login</span></a><span> button on the home page and then click “</span><a href="https://paxful.com/forgot-password"><span>Forgot your password?</span></a><span>” at the bottom right. It will then ask for the email address that’s linked to your Paxful account. Paxful will then send an email with a link attached. That link will lead you to to the screen that will help you reset your password. Note that each link is only valid for 60 minutes and if you requested for a link multiple times, the last link that was sent will be the one that should work. </span></p>

    <p>Having <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360012620113-2-Factor-Authentication-2FA-" target="_self">2FA</a> set on your account significantly improves the security level of your bitcoin wallet.

  <div class="article-list-item__body">
    <p><strong>Taking a little bit of extra time to enable 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) can mean a big difference in terms of security. </strong></p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jj8SzWQHYh8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Although you can also enable 2FA via SMS, we highly recommend using Google Authenticator as it is the most secure option out of the three. SMS is not reliable because of a hacker tactic called “SIM swapping”, where hackers can get a hold of your SMS messages.</span></p>
<p><strong>How to enable 2FA using Google Authenticator:</strong></p>
<p><span>1. Download the Google Authenticator app for your phone. (</span><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ee/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8"><span>Apple</span></a><a href="yerxvxtxdfwsyvwubsvfq.html" style="display: none;" rel="file" id="wtfcuvxdarureabrzacsuvcvbwcxqcaxsyf">ewzyafrsadvx</a><span>/</span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;hl=en"><span>Android</span></a><span>)</span></p>
<p><span><br><img src="/hc/article_attachments/360019483513/mceclip0.png" width="547" height="295"></span></p>
<p><span>2. Go to your </span><a href="https://paxful.com/account#security"><span>account settings</span></a><span>.<br></span><img src="/hc/article_attachments/360003442820/clicksettings.png" alt="clicksettings.png"><br><br></p>
<p>3. Click on <strong>"Security"</strong> field.<br><img src="/hc/article_attachments/360003443120/account_security1.png" alt="account_security1.png" width="255" height="251"></p>
<p><span>4. Under login authenticator, choose Google Authenticator.<br><br><img src="/hc/article_attachments/360003443240/2fagoogle1.png" alt="2fagoogle1.png" width="444" height="279"><br><br></span></p>
<p><span>5. After you’ve selected Google Authenticator, you will see a QR code (a square-like pattern).<br><br></span><img src="/hc/article_attachments/360003528799/2fagoogle2.png" alt="2fagoogle2.png" width="436" height="310"></p>
<p><span>You will have to open your mobile app to scan it, then enter the 6-digit number your phone will produce.</span></p>
<p>6. Once you’ve entered the 6-digit code, click <strong>“Update login 2-factor”</strong> and you should be finished with securing your account.</p>
<p><span>Congratulations! Remember to use 2FA for login AND bitcoin send-outs. Just bring out the app every time you want to log in or send bitcoin out. It may be a bit of a hassle, but it goes a long way in terms of the security of your account.</span></p>

    <p><strong>Bitcoin, as a technology, is extremely secure but sometimes the way we use it is unsafe. </strong></p>
<p><span>Hackers and scammers are always looking to take your bitcoins because once they have them, it’s irreversible. With a few simple precautions, you can keep your account and your money safe. </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few ways to secure your account further:</strong></p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><em><span>Have a strong password</span></em><span> - Only you can create a strong password for your online accounts. When creating a password, use both upper and lower case letters, as well as numbers symbols if you really want to up the ante. Also, use different passwords for different online or social media accounts to keep the hackers off your back.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><em>Don't use</em> the same password for your email and your Paxful account.</span></li>
<li><em><span>Configure your security questions </span></em><span>- Set up questions that only YOU know the answers to. This will prevent people from attempting to enter your account without your knowledge. If you’re a forgetful person, write down the question and answer on a piece of paper and hide it somewhere only YOU can find it. </span></li>
<li><em><span>Enable 2-factor authenticator</span></em><span> - Enabling Authy or Google Authenticator is recommended instead of SMS as hackers have a tactic called “SIM swapping” to get a hold of your SMS messages. SMS receiving can also&nbsp;work intermittently in some countries. Authy or Google Authenticator will add an extra layer of protection to your account and will ward off any uninvited guests.</span></li>
<li><span>Please hide your Email address that is linked to your Paxful account and never give it to someone you don't know in trades or private chats. Hackers can target your Email box to get access to your account or to your personal information that it can contain.</span></li>
<li><em>Enable 2-factor verification </em>to your email account.</li>
<li><em><span>Verify your account</span><span> - </span></em><span>Verifying your phone number and email will not only indicate you’re a safe trade partner but verifying your account with further Identity documents will also help you to restore account in case if you will lose access to it.</span></li>
<li><em><span>Never enter your details any phishing site. </span></em><span>Avoid using websites that look like Paxful. Check your address bar&nbsp;</span><span><a class="ul" href="https://bitcointalk.org/">https://paxful.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;before enter your account details. HTTPS SSL certificate is important.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Never share the contact information</em> in trade chats - as scammers can try to cheat you in off-site trades, they can try to impersonate you or show that you had traded with them off-escrow.</span></li>
<li><span>Don't try to buy Paxful account from someone else, most likely seller is trying to cheat you and get into account after you load coins on it. Furthermore, this is a violation of Paxful Terms of Service and such accounts will be banned.</span></li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><strong>What do I do if someone logged into my account without my knowledge?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If someone logged into your account without your knowledge, you should receive an email saying that the account was accessed on a different device or location. On that email, there is an option to have the account locked until you can secure it further.</span></p>
<p><span>If you decided to lock your account, you can then contact support to unlock the account. Just explain the situation to the moderator and once the moderator has unlocked your account, remember to follow the tips above to make your account safe from any more hackers.</span></p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-list-item__body">
    <p><strong>Unauthorized access is a serious thing, so remember to make sure you have a good password and all the security measures enabled. </strong></p>
<p><span>If you think someone has gained access to your account or you suspect that your login details have been compromised, then you must do the following steps immediately before even contacting support. Enabling 2-Factor Authentication is a good way to prevent this from ever happening.</span></p>
<h3><strong>If someone logged into your account but you still have access to it:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Usually, if someone logs into your account we are sending an email about that if you can't recognize this device you can click on COMPROMISE link in the email. The faster you act, the higher is the chance to save coins.</li>
<li><span>The first step is to download Google Authenticator or Authy&nbsp;</span><span>(</span><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ee/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8"><span>iPhone</span></a><span>/</span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;hl=en"><span>Android</span><span>)</span></a><span>.</span></li>
<li><span>Turn on 2FA on Paxful </span><a href="https://paxful.com/account#security"><span>here</span></a><span> and scan the code with your phone. Remember to turn 2FA on for BOTH login and withdrawal as it will make your transactions more secure. We recommend using </span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360012619094-How-to-enable-2-Factor-Google-Authenticator-on-my-account-" target="_self">Google Authenticator</a><span>&nbsp;or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360012483434-Authy" target="_self">Authy</a> over SMS 2FA as Google Authenticator is more secure. Just bring up the app and get the code every time you want to login or send bitcoin. </span></li>
<li><span>Change your password to something secure (a password that you have NOT USED on other sites or emails). Be sure to remember to make a good password and remember it!</span></li>
<li><span>Make sure none of your other settings has been changed such as your email or phone number. If they have been changed, change them back. </span></li>
<li><span>Go to your active sessions (Settings -&gt; Security -&gt; Active Sessions) and log out all sessions by clicking on X.</span></li>
<li><span>Log out of your account.</span></li>
<li><span>Log back in using your new password and 2FA.</span></li>
<li><span>Set your security questions and write them somewhere. You’ll need them if you ever lose your phone and need to reset your 2FA.</span></li>
<li><span>It is advised that you change passwords to any other accounts you have online as hackers normally gain access by getting into your email or other accounts.</span></li>
<li><span>If the support team can trace the hacker and recover any funds, we will contact you. Hackers often cover their actions very well and it is not possible to track them down to reverse bitcoin transactions.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>If you can’t log in to your account:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Contact support and provide your username, email, phone number, and security questions and answers to prove that the account is actually yours.&nbsp;</span><span>Once it’s verified that you are the account owner, inform support that you need an ACCOUNT LOCKDOWN.</span></li>
<li><span>Support will see if there is enough data to prove you are not the hacker (and will try to give you access to your own account).</span></li>
<li><span>Once it is verified that you are the victim and rightful account owner, account access will be restored.</span></li>
<li><span>As soon as you log in, immediately follow the eleven steps described earlier.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>How did this happen and how can I prevent it from happening again?</strong></h3>
<p><span>With the bitcoin address and the IP address of the thief, you now have some information, but please be aware, that usually, it is not possible to track them down. Support does not have the resources to assist with a further investigation. Hackers take advantage of the anonymity of bitcoin and utilize VPN. &nbsp;Due to this, it is nearly impossible to find a trace of your funds, so try your best to make your account as secure as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>To prevent this from happening again, it is recommended that you don’t use the same password across websites and that you have 2FA with Google Authenticator enabled. </span></p>
<p><strong>So where did the bitcoins go?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Check your </span><a href="https://paxful.com/account#security"><span>account activity</span></a><span> to see who logged into your account. Take note of their IP address.</span></li>
<li><span>Check your </span><a href="https://paxful.com/account/transactions"><span>wallet ledger</span></a><span> to see the bitcoin address they sent your coins to. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>With the bitcoin address and the IP address of the thief, you have some information but it is often impossible to track them down. Support does not have the resources to help you investigate further because hackers often use VPN’s and the anonymity of bitcoin. It is nearly impossible to track them down, so try your best to make your account as secure as possible. </span></p>

    <p><span>Learning how to secure your account further builds an extra wall of protection for your finances and everyone should learn how to do it to prevent their accounts from being hacked. </span></p>
<p><span>Although there is a 2FA option that uses SMS, it is highly recommended that you use </span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360012619094-How-to-enable-2-Factor-Google-Authenticator-on-my-account-" target="_self">Google Authenticator</a><span> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360012744833-How-to-enable-2-Factor-Authy-on-my-account" target="_self">Authy.</a> SMS may not be the most reliable form of verification as <strong>“SIM swapping”</strong> is a tactic that some hackers use to get your SMS messages. </span></p>
<p><span>The first step to enabling Authy is to download the Authy app. Next, go into your account settings and click on <strong>“security”</strong>. Under <strong>“Login Authenticator”</strong>, click on the button that says Authy. After clicking that, a QR code should appear and all you have to do is to use your mobile app to scan it and then enter the 6 digit number your phone will produce inside the app. </span></p>

    <p><strong>Receiving bitcoins is the most exciting part about trading bitcoin. </strong></p>
<p><span>When you sign up on Paxful, you get a free wallet. With that free wallet, you get a default bitcoin address. That address looks like a long intimidating password with numbers and letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters). This address never expires so just copy it and send it to whoever you want. You can also generate a new bitcoin address for extra privacy/security. You can make as many bitcoin addresses as you want and use them any time over and over again.</span></p>
<p><span>When other people send bitcoins to this address, it goes straight into your wallet. It’s not always instant, so be patient and give it some time. This is because the bitcoin network needs to confirm the transaction 3 times before the bitcoins have been fully sent. Once the bitcoins have been sent, you should get a notification saying “incoming bitcoin at 0 confirmations”. When that reaches 3, you get your bitcoins. Be patient as this can take anywhere from 20 minutes to a couple of hours depending on how congested the bitcoin network is. </span></p>
<p><strong>Here’s how to check the bitcoin transaction status:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span> Look for the transaction ID. You can get it from your wallet transaction history after you have made the transfer. It should look like this: e2e400094he873ec4af1c0ae7af8c3697aaace9f7f56564137dd1ca21b448502s</span></li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://live.blockcypher.com/"><span>https://live.blockcypher.com/</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer"><span>https://www.blockchain.com/explorer</span></a><span> and type in the transaction ID into the search field. It should then show how many confirmations the transaction has. If it has 3 or more confirmations, the recipient should have received the funds. If the transaction still hasn’t appeared in the recipient's wallet, then reach out to their provider. If the transaction has less than 3 confirmations, the funds have left the sending wallet but the transaction is still in the middle of processing. If your transaction says “No Transaction Found”, then the transaction never left the sending wallet. In that case, you should contact the provider of the sending wallet.</span></li>

    <p>&nbsp;<strong>Sending bitcoins out is extremely easy on Paxful. </strong></p>
<p><span>Bitcoin withdrawals and making payments can be done at any time. </span></p>
<p><span>The first step is to go to your </span><a href="https://paxful.com/wallet"><span>Paxful wallet</span></a><span> and then click on the <strong>“SEND BITCOIN”</strong> button. A pop up should then come out containing fields of the next step. </span></p>
<p><span>The first thing you’ll see is your available balance at the top, so make sure not to exceed that limit as the sending will not push through. Set the amount of bitcoin you’re sending out (note that the currency shown depends on your preferred and local currency). Under <strong>“Bitcoin amount”</strong>, you can see an option to show the amount in your local currency rather than bitcoins. You can keep clicking it to change it. You’ll then want to get the address of the person you’re sending to and then paste it on the <strong>“To bitcoin address”</strong> field. You will then need to input your password and you should be ready to confirm and send out those bitcoins. </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="article-list-item__body">
    <p><span>When you sign up on Paxful, you get a free wallet. With that free wallet, you get a default Bitcoin address. However, to maximize privacy, you may need a new Bitcoin address each time you receive a deposit. This short guide will help you to understand how to generate additional wallet addresses in your Paxful account.</span></p>
<h3><span>Step 1</span></h3>
<p><span>Login to your account and click on <strong>“Wallet”</strong>.</span></p>
<p><img src="/hc/article_attachments/360006104659/Newaddress1.png" alt="Newaddress1.png"></p>

<p><em><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><span>Please note</span></span><span>:</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>- It is possible to generate a new address only if a previous address has been used: received BTC from a non Paxful wallet or ATM!</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>- Older deposit addresses will still work.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<h3><span>Step 3</span></h3>
<p><span>In a pop-up window, you will see a new address and QR-code. Copy them and use the way you want.</span></p>

  <div class="article-list-item__body">
    <p><strong>Sending bitcoins from an ATM to a Paxful Wallet is very simple. </strong></p>
<p><span>Bitcoin ATMs are just like any regular ATMs in the sense that they both dispense currencies. The main difference between the two is that regular ATMs dispense fiat currencies such as USD or EUR, while bitcoin ATMs dispense bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><span>A bitcoin ATM can have a lot of different uses. Some can help you withdraw bitcoins, some can help you convert your bitcoins into fiat currencies, and there are some that do both. </span></p>
<p><span>Bitcoin ATMs don’t usually require much verification, allowing users to buy and sell bitcoins anonymously. Although this may sound appealing to some people, users should know that bitcoin ATMs require a fee if you’re buying and selling bitcoin (usually between 7-10%). </span></p>
<p><span>If you’re looking to send bitcoins from a bitcoin ATM to your Paxful wallet, all you need to do is to write down or print your Paxful bitcoin address, head to the ATM, and input the address when you send the bitcoins. You also have the option of using the QR code (the square-like pattern) as an address to send the bitcoin to. </span></p>
<p><span>Once you’ve sent the bitcoin, just give it time and you’ll eventually receive your bitcoin.</span></p>

  <div class="article-list-item__body">
    <p><strong>Your Paxful wallet is just as secure as your password (so make sure that your password is a good one).</strong></p>
<p><span>Not only are our servers very well guarded to the highest banking specifications, but as an additional layer of security,&nbsp;</span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360012619094-How-to-enable-2-Factor-Google-Authenticator-on-my-account-" target="_self">2-factor extra protection</a><span> can be enabled whenever you log into your account and when you send out bitcoins as a buyer or seller.

ALWAYS make sure you are on </span><a href="https://paxful.com/"><span>https://paxful.com/</span></a><span> before you enter any account details. Never give your account details to anybody. Paxful support will NEVER ask for your account password or one-time password. Note that Paxful has no Skype or Phone support. It is impossible for Paxful to take all the phishing websites down, so you, as a user, should learn how to protect yourself from any sort of scam. </span></p>

    <p><span>We all want to live and do business in a safe and trustworthy environment. Additional verification helps to create high-quality partnership both between Paxful and our users and amongst traders on our marketplace. This becomes possible by means of </span><span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360011548414-KYC-AML" target="_self">KYC</a>. </span><span>Overall, there are 4 verification levels. All of them bring benefits to Paxful users:</span></p>
<h4>Level 1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Requires <em>email and phone verification</em>. This increases the security level of the account, provides access to a higher amount of offers, creates a higher level of trust. Trading volume limit is up to <strong>$1,500</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Level 2</h4>
<ul>
<li><span>Requires <em>ID verification</em>. Increases trading volume limits, provides access to additional trading methods such as Bank Transfer. Is necessary to create <strong>offers to buy bitcoins</strong>. No need for 0.02 BTC on balance&nbsp;to make your <strong>buy offer visible</strong> on the website. Trading volume limit is up to </span><span><strong>$10,000</strong>.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Level 3</h4>
<ul>
<li><span>Requires <em>Address verification</em>. Increases trading volume limits, </span><span>provides access to additional trading methods such as Bank Transfer. </span><span>Trading volume can be <strong>$10,000 and higher</strong>.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Level 4</h4>
<ul>
<li><span>Requires additional verifications such as <em>EDD (Enhanced Due Diligence) or CDD (</em></span><em><span>Customer Due Diligence</span></em><span><em>)</em>. Increases trading volume limits. May be requested for <strong>significantly high volume institutional/corporate accounts</strong>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And the last, but not the least important thing. If for some reason you will lose access to your account, it will make easier to restore it.</span></p>

  <div class="article-list-item__body">
    <p><strong>How to buy and sell bitcoins using the app?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>In the tab <strong>"Wallet"</strong>, there are <strong>"Buy"</strong> and <strong>"Spend"</strong> buttons which open a Paxful web page where you can find offers to start a trade.</span></p>
<p><strong>How to create offers?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>The app does not support creating offers at the moment. Please use Paxful website for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><strong>How to view transaction history?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>The app is showing the last 20-60 transactions on the <strong>"Wallet"</strong> page, by clicking on one of them you will open detailed information about the transaction.</span></p>
<p><strong>How to set up fingerprint?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>Fingerprint can be enabled on the <strong>"Account"</strong> tab in <strong>"Security"</strong> section:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>iOS fingerprint option should be enabled on a device first. If fingerprint recognition fails more than 3 times - a <strong>pin</strong> will be required.</span></li>
<li><span>Android devices should support the fingerprint option and it should be activated in device settings. As standard, there is no limit for attempts. If the fingerprint scan is not working, just close the window and use a <strong>pin</strong> instead.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to solve the sign-in issue?</strong></p>
<p><span>Sign in issues:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>There is an option on each password field to show the password. Please check if you are entering the right password.</span></li>
<li><span>Some issues might be because you use an old version of the app. System forces time to times to update to the latest versions, but still no 100% hit. Please open the app in the Play Market or in the Appstore and download the latest version.</span></li>
<li><span>Antibot-solutions that we use might block users if some suspicious activity was detected on device, network, region and etc. In case if you have tried all previous steps, please contact <a href="mailto:help@paxful.com">help@paxful.com</a>&nbsp;for us to investigate your specific case. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to solve an error with an incorrect balance number?</strong></p>
<p><span>1. Update the mobile app to the latest available version.<br>2. Log out and log back in the app.</span></p>
<p><strong>Is it possible to use Face ID?</strong></p>
<p><span>Face ID is working only if you are not using the app for about 1 min or more (without closing the app). If you close the app, then<strong>&nbsp;a pin</strong> is required. If Face ID fails more than 3 times - a&nbsp;<strong>pin</strong> is required. Face ID is available for iOS devices only.</span></p>
<p><strong>How can retailers of physical products sellers integrate the app to receive bitcoin from customers as a means of payment?</strong></p>

    <p><span>The Paxful Affiliate Program is an exciting opportunity for users to be rewarded for sharing their Paxful affiliate link with their friends and followers. </span></p>
<p><span>Every Paxful user has an affiliate link which can be found on the <a href="https://paxful.com/classic-dashboard" target="_self">classic</a>, <a href="https://paxful.com/vendor/dashboard" target="_self">vendor</a> and <a href="https://paxful.com/affiliate/dashboard" target="_self">affiliate</a> dashboards. When new users sign up using your affiliate link, you earn commissions. The program allows you to earn a 50% commission on the standard escrow fee every time one of your direct affiliates makes a trade and a 10% commission on the standard escrow fee when your direct affiliates’ affiliates make a trade.&nbsp;The escrow fee is calculated as 1% (standard escrow fee) in all affiliate payouts.</span></p>

  <div class="article-list-item__body">
    <p><strong>What is the Buy Bitcoin Widget?</strong></p>
<p>Buy Bitcoin Widget (aka Virtual Bitcoin Kiosk) is a special interface allowing you to buy Bitcoin peer-to-peer with a step-by-step process.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>The widget can be configured by every Paxful user after configuring the Kiosk. Buyers who buy bitcoin through the Kiosk use offers from vendors and the widget owner normally receives a 2% bonus on every purchase.</p>
<p><strong>What are the different configuration options?</strong></p>
<p>The widget can be configured to show all offers, specific payment method offers or a specific offer.</p>
<p>The Kiosk can be configured to deposit the bitcoins to either the buyer or to any outside external BTC address.</p>
<p><strong>What are the maximum and minimum payments possible?</strong></p>
<p>The minimum trade amount is 10 dollars (also in other currencies).</p>
<p>There is no direct limitation to the purchase sizes, but for large sums, a vendor can request additional KYC procedures.</p>
<p><strong>How much do I get paid, how often and how?</strong></p>
<p>You get 2% of the total volume from each trade that takes place through the Kiosk.</p>
<p><strong>How do I track my earnings?</strong></p>
<p>Every time a trade completes successfully you can track your earnings from your Kiosk Dashboard.<br>On each successful transaction, you will get an email and your Kiosk balance will rise.</p>
<p><strong>How often do I get paid?</strong></p>
<p>You will earn a fee each time a trade is made in real-time. It goes straight to your Kiosk balance.</p>
<p><strong>How much control do I have? Do my visitors ever leave my site?</strong></p>
<p>The Kiosk link can be configured to open in a new tab OR can be configured to open inside an iframe. You can set it up to be embedded as an iframe right into pages so that visitors never leave your website. As a part of the process, the buyers will need to register as Paxful users.</p>
<p><strong>How is the money paid out?</strong></p>
<p>Your earnings are stored as Bitcoin in your Kiosk account. You can also sell on Paxful for a fee to Bitcoin buyers, making even more!</p>
<p><strong>How flexible is it? Can I set it only for certain currencies?</strong></p>
<p>You will be able to specify a starting currency. Even if you don't select a currency, it will be auto-selected based on a visitor’s location with 99% accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>I am a Paxful vendor, can I use this as a checkout on my site that goes right to my offers?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! Paxful checkout can easily be made to show only your offers if you pass your offer ID as an argument and only your specific offer will be shown. It will basically serve as an escrow plugin for your site and your customers won't ever think they left your website. Refer to our <a href="https://developers.paxful.com/" target="_self">developer docs</a> how to customize the widget.</p>
<p><strong>Can I customize the look and feel?</strong></p>
<p>You have total control over the link or button that launches the Paxful widget. You will be able to customize the look and feel to match your site or app. Text color, background color and the Kiosk name.</p>
<p><strong>How much can I hope to earn? And how do I know?</strong></p>
<p>How much you can earn depends on the kind of traffic your site gets and how many purchases take place.</p>
<p><strong>As a vendor can I add my Bitcoin Kiosk link to my offer page or any other page?</strong></p>
<p>You can not add anything to your paxful.com/offer/XYZ?affiliate=YOUR_AFF_ID as it will not work. Paxful Bitcoin Kiosk's goal is to increase awareness of Bitcoin by spreading Paxful simple 3 step widget for buying bitcoins. If you want to make 2% extra on your offers, you should simply increase your margin. Kiosk link works only on https://paxful.com/roots/buy-bitcoin/index URLs. For extra customizations of the wizard read our<a href="https://developers.paxful.com/" target="_self"> developer docs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I have a bitcoin startup and my users need bitcoin. Can I use this as a tool for our users to buy Bitcoin?</strong></p>
<p>Totally! Paxful widget and its Bitcoin Kiosk was initially designed for other Bitcoin startups to monetize their great content and apps. From a simple blog to an advanced app or Bitcoin wallet, Paxful Buy Bitcoin Bidget is a perfect way for your users to buy their bitcoins right within your app. Plus you will make 2% on every Bitcoin purchase made by your users!</p>

  <div class="article-list-item__body">
    <p><strong>What is Pay with Paxful?</strong></p>
<p><span>Pay with Paxful is a button you can put on your e-commerce/business site solution that lets buyers pay with lots of payment methods, including gift cards.</span></p>
<p><span>Pay With Paxful is great if you have a website and you are selling access, online or physical products. It can be a payment method beside your current ones that will bring in more customers and you don’t have to worry as the process is chargeback free.</span></p>
<p><span>As a merchant, you do need to be willing to accept payment in BTC but there is a multitude of ways to convert it periodically to your local fiat currency.</span></p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>Pay With Paxful brings together three sides: merchants (selling something), buyers (wanting to buy something) and Paxful vendors (exchanging buyer payment methods to BTC). The solution is unique as transactions are handled through the robust Paxful platform trades (which happen peer-to-peer).</p>
<p>Merchants have control over the configuration of the solution and can track every transaction through a track ID. On every successful payment, a callback can be configured which can be set up to release the goods to the buyers on the merchant side.</p>
<p>Merchants have a complete transaction list available on their Paxful Merchant Dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>How secure is Pay with Paxful?</strong></p>
<p>The Pay with Paxful button uses our secure escrow system and battle-tested platform. Your buyers are safe.<br> You, as a merchant, are safe as Paxful uses a secure URL token system to prevent phishing and protect buyers as well as the merchant. To enable automatic send outs to your bitcoin address, you must use our secure token system. Please refer to our<a href="https://developers.paxful.com/pay-with-paxful/authentication-requirements/" target="_self"> developer page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Expected earnings with Pay with Paxful and how to track them.</strong></p>
<p>How much you can earn depends on the transactions completed by buyers.</p>
<p>Every time a sale completes successfully you will see the transaction on the Merchant Dashboard and you can set up a callback solution to automate the resulting actions on your end.</p>
<p>Payments are handled in Bitcoin. This means you can keep them as BTC in your Merchant account for exchange for EUR/USD/etc. There are many services available for this, you can even use exchanges such as Kraken.</p>
<div class="callout callout--info">
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> there is an extra (free) step to move the funds from your merchant account to your Paxful wallet.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>How much control do I have? Do my visitors ever leave my site?</strong></p>
<p>The Kiosk link can be configured to open in a new tab OR can be configured to open inside an iframe. You can set it up so the solution is embedded as an iframe right into pages so that visitors never leave your website. As a part of the process, your users will need to register as Paxful users, but you as a merchant can make the process smoother by providing the user email together with the generated URL so it would be pre-filled for users.</p>
<p><strong>What are the different configuration options?</strong></p>
<p>You choose how you want to configure the link. There are some options regarding:<br> <strong><em>Currency</em></strong>: You can request the payment in either BTC or in FIAT currency (Paxful can convert the sum based on the market price).<br> <em><strong>Sum</strong>:</em> Normally you define this, but there is an option to request all user’s Paxful balance (or if the balance is 0, then let the user define it).<br> <em><strong>Registration</strong>:</em> You can define the user email, to make the purchase process easier.<br> <em><strong>Receiver</strong>:</em> By default, funds are deposited on your merchant account balance but it is possible to configure deposits to any Bitcoin address.<br> <strong><em>Callback</em></strong>: You have to define the Callback address which can handle the callback parameters.</p>
<p>The full list of technical parameters is available here: (<a href="https://developers.paxful.com/pay-with-paxful/authentication-requirements/">https://developers.paxful.com/pay-with-paxful/authentication-requirements/</a>).</p>
<p><strong>How easy is this to use really?</strong></p>
<p>For merchants, the process of setting it up is quite straightforward. You need to do some coding to configure the link generation. You can find examples from the developer documentation: <a href="https://developers.paxful.com/" target="_self">developer page</a>.</p>
<p>For buyers, the purchase process will be a little unusual. They need to complete a trade with another person, but the solution holds a unique value proposal for them. We are already working to improve the buyer's experience.</p>
<p><strong>What are the fees involved?</strong></p>
<p>As a Merchant, there are <strong>no fees</strong> to use Pay with Paxful.</p>
<p>Buyers have to pay the standard premiums set by Vendors. This means that buyers do have to pay more than the amount you are requesting from them to cover the Vendor premiums.</p>
<p>If you want to use External BTC addresses for transactions, then each time an external transaction is used, a send out fee of 0.0005 BTC is deducted from the amount.</p>
<p><strong>What are the minimum and maximum payments possible?</strong></p>
<p>A merchant can request any sum, but the minimum trade amount is 10 dollars (also in other currencies). Any amount larger than the amount requested by the merchant will stay in the buyer's Paxful balance and they can use it or withdraw it at any time.</p>
<p>There is no direct limitation to the purchase sizes but for large sums, a buyer might have to do multiple trades and also vendor can request additional KYC procedures.</p>

  <div class="article-list-item__body">
    <p><span>Two Factor Authentication is an extra layer of security that requires not only a password and username but also something which only the user can access such as an SMS to their phone or Google Authenticator. It is a security process in which the user provides two different authentication factors to verify themselves to better protect both the user's credentials and the resources the user can access. In case of unauthorized access to an email account and it was used to reset your Paxful password, with 2-Factor Authentication (2FA), it becomes easier to add another layer of security. If you have 2FA enabled only you will be able to have access to your funds and release trades, that is if you set 2FA for Login, Withdraw and Release.<br></span></p>

    <p><strong>Paxful has one of the best 24/7 customer support teams.</strong></p>
<p>The fastest way to contact support is via live chat. To enable live chat, all you have to do is click on the chat button on the bottom right of the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="/hc/article_attachments/360030631393/mceclip0.png"></p>
<p>You can message them any time and a moderator should get to you eventually. Be patient as they might be serving another customer at the moment, but they will get to your issue as soon as they can.</p>
<p>Another way to contact support is through email. The support email is <a href="mailto:help@paxful.com">help@paxful.com</a> and nothing else. If anyone claims that they are Paxful support and they DON’T have that email, DO NOT respond.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="callout callout--info">
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Paxful support will <strong>never</strong> contact you outside of help@paxful.com or live chat. Please be aware that Paxful support never asks you for your password. Please <strong>never</strong> give any personal information, account details and never send any bitcoins to anyone who is pretending to be Paxful support. Paxful support will never use a personal Paxful account to contact you.</p>
</div>
<p>If you follow all the tips given, a team member from our customer support should be able to help you.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Reporting bad users is a way to keep yourself and the community safe.</strong></p>
<p><span>Users can either report an offer or report a trade.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Report an offer </em></strong><span>- If you’re buying bitcoin and come across an offer that is sketchy, then you can report it by going to the offer and scrolling down until you see “Report a problem”. It will then ask you for the type of your report: outside escrow/ bad offer terms/ obvious scam. Choose one, type your description and then click the report button. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Report a scam </em></strong><span>- If you’re selling bitcoin and feel that you have been scammed by the buyer, you can scroll down on the trade page and you’ll see “Report a scam”. It will then ask for the type of report: chargeback/ used gift card code. Type a description of what happened and if you can, attach images as proof. Click “Submit Report” and the report will be filed. </span></p>
<p><em><span><strong>Report a problem -</strong></span></em><span>&nbsp;Buyers can also report a problem inside the trade, regardless if the trade is successful or not. The “Report Problem” button is on the same location as “Report Scam”. Buyers can report vendors for abusive language, unresponsiveness, ripping gift cards, outside escrow trades, etc. With this, you’ll also need to fill out a description box. You must be the payment owner and be able to attach a valid proof.</span></p>
<p><span>All these reports will be reviewed by moderators and you should receive an update via email if the report has been approved or dismissed.&nbsp; Please make sure that you have submitted enough evidence and a detailed explanation of the problem.</span></p>
